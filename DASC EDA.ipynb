    "<b>track_popularity</b> is the song's Popularity (0-100) where 0 is not popular and 100 is extrememly popular<br>\n",

    "<b>track_album_name</b> is the song's album name<br>\n",

    "<b>playlist_id</b> is the playlist ID<br>\n",
    "<b>playlist_genre</b> is the playlist genre<br>\n",

    "<b>danceability</b> is how suitable a track is for dancing. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable.\n",
    "energy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. <br>\n",
    "<b>key</b> is the estimated overall key of the track. Integers map to pitches using standard Pitch Class notation . E.g. 0 = C, 1 = C♯/D♭, 2 =  D, and so on. If no key was detected, the value is -1.<br>\n",
    "<b>loudness</b> is the overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Values typical range between -60 and 0 db.<br>\n",
    "<b>mode</b> indicates the modality (major or minor) of a track, the type of scale from which its melodic content is derived. Major is represented by 1 and minor is 0.<br>\n",
    "<b>speechiness</b> is the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value. Values above 0.66 describe tracks that are probably made entirely of spoken words. Values between 0.33 and 0.66 describe tracks that may contain both music and speech, either in sections or layered, including such cases as rap music. Values below 0.33 most likely represent music and other non-speech-like tracks.<br>\n",
    "<b>acousticness</b> is a confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic. 1.0 represents high confidence the track is acoustic.<br>\n",
    "<b>instrumentalness</b> is whether a track contains no vocals.  The closer the instrumentalness value is to 1.0, the greater likelihood the track contains no vocal content. Values above 0.5 are intended to represent instrumental tracks, but confidence is higher as the value approaches 1.0.<br>\n",
    "<b>liveness</b> is the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased probability that the track was performed live. A value above 0.8 provides strong likelihood that the track is live.<br>\n",
    "<b>valence</b> is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).<br>\n",
    "<b>tempo</b> is overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM). <br>\n",
    "<b>duration_ms</b> is the duration of song in milliseconds<br>\n",
